# Horizon Ramdisk

The Horizon Ramdisk is a battery-backed RAM-based storage device for the TI-99/4A home computer and the Myarc Geneve 9640 computer. The original peripheral card was released during the 1980s when slow, 90K floppy disks were the most common storage medium.  See the Wiki for more information.
