=====================================================================

GENCFG is a command line utility required to format the Horizon RAMdisk
for use with MDOS 7.30+. Each physical Ramdisk may be configured with
one bootable "disk" partition of 1440, 1600, or 3200 sectors.  All remaining
space will be formatted as a hard drive parition, referred to as "RamHD".


HARDWARE PREPARATION
--------------------
1. The ramdisk must NOT have the "TI" 32K ram option installed

2. You must NOT use the Phoenix CRU DIP switch settings; Phoenix was
   deprecated in 1990 and is incompatible with the current OS.

3. The ramdisk MUST be set to CRU 1000, 1400, 1600, or 1700
       - 1400 is the default CRU for a bootable partition
       - MDOS defaults DSK6. to this device for Autoexec

4. Version 1.5 will format ramdisks smaller than 800k. If your old
   hardware does not work with GenCFG, please notify via the forum.  Be
   sure to attempt formatting with FORM v1.23 so we can compare operation.

5. Update to MDOS / Geneve OS 7.40.


USAGE:
=======
GenCFG is run from the Geneve OS command line or batch file. The program
may be run interactively or used to display current system information.

     Example:  GENCFG         Interactive (no parameters)
               GENCFG -disp   Display devices and exit (for bat file users)


OPTIONS:
--------
Q)uit       - Exit the program and return to the command line
F)ormat     - Format a detected ramdisk
S)can       - Rescan peripherals; useful if you need to toggle the ramdisk
B)ootflag   - Toggle the bootflag for a detected ramdisk
R)ecoverHD  - Not yet implemented; future option to restore partition info
I)dentify   - Turns on the LED of the selected ramdisk for PEB identification


FORMAT:
--------
Unlike prior format programs (FORM, FORM3MEG), GenCFG detects the ramdisks
in a non-destructive manner.  User confirmation is required at two stages.

If you intend to boot MDOS from the ramdisk, you must create a disk partition
during the format process.  MDOS must be loaded within the first 1024 sectors
of the disk partition. It is therefore recommended that you copy SYSTEM/SYS
immediately after the format session.

1. Select (F)ormat
2. Select the CRU associated with the ramdisk to format
3. GenCFG will turn on the card for visual verification
4. If ramdisk header is found, you will be asked to proceed or abort
5. You will be given the choice of disk partitions (1440,1600,3200, none)
      *If <800K, a 4th option will appear to format all available sectors
      *If no partition is selected, all sectors are allocated to the RamHD
6. GenCFG will summarize the format selections
7. GenCG will ask you to confirm.  Press FCTN-6 to format; ESC to abort
8. Format will complete


BOOT FLAG
----------
Toggle the "B" column to "Y" to enable booting from the DSK partition.
Limitations apply; it is best to use ramdisk at >1400 for boot operations



POST-FORMAT
-----------
The Geneve OS maps drives to specific devices.  If you are not familiar with
this concept, please review the OS documentation.

ALL drive remap commands should be added to your AUTOEXEC file

-Disk Partition Examples:
       REMAP 6N          Remaps DSK6. to Horizon ramdisk at 1400 (1401)
       REMAP 9O          Remaps DSK9. to Horizon ramdisk at 1600 (1601)

-RamHD Partition Examples
The ramHD partition is access via the SCSx device. Use SCSMAP:
       SCSMAP 38         Remap SCS3. to Horizon ramdisk at >1400
       SCSMAP 49         Remap SCS4. to Horizon ramdisk at >1600

* Note, CRU 1000 and 1700 are unavailable for RamHD at this time

***** WARNING *****

If you remap/scsmap a drive that was previously mapped to an available drive,
it is recommended that you perform a cold restart before accessing it!

Future OS enhancements may reduce the need to restart.
